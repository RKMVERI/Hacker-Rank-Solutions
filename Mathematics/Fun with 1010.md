When you look at photographs of watches and clocks, you'll find that they almost always show the time 10:10. There are lots of theories and even urban legends about this. For example, when showing 10:10, the hands look like a smile, and so you are more inclined to buy the watch or clock :D (a form of subliminal advertising).

Now, you are given  and . You are to find the number of sequences  such that:

 is a number of the form  for some ,
If , then  is divisible by , and  is divisible by , and
 are squarefree.
Since the number can be very large, only give the number modulo .

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer , which is the number of test cases. The following lines contain the test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers,  and .
